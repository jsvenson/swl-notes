Solomon Priest's Tomb

A CONFESSION,
penned in the Year under the Eye 1702,
Kingsmouth Town

One night consider this an Admission to two Acts of Cowardice, and also of bad Faith within the Enlightened Order, and as such I shall see to it that this Missive, once written, is sequestered with my own Corpse. My Time on this Earth runs short, and Much is left to be Undertaken; by this I mean the Order, and by our Third, but more on that Apiece.

The Remains of Solomon Priest were moved at my Instruction, by Loyal Men, who fashioned for him a new Rest within the Tunnels. On this matter I declare my Reasoning was to prevent our Enemies and Consorts alike from Digging too Deeply. The trail to the new Tomb shall die with my Retainers and my Self, and so too shall die any Looter or Gawker seeking to negotiate its Traps, should they not hold Enlightened Knowledge.

cont. on second page:

To the Second Part, then, the reason for this Deception is that I did take the man's life, all true, I did Poison him as the Rumours have long circulated, and likely shall Continue. For truly it was less an act of urder as of Martyring, and though I assumed his Duries I perform them with Hollow Ritual, and as his Name is remembered, mine remains in his considerable Shadow. In the one score of Years since my Fateful Act, I have come to accept this was always my Rightful Place, and in seeking to Unseat him, I did only Seal it so Forevermore.

The Third knew of my Treachery, of this I am Certain, even though he remained in London; now finally, as I breathe my last, he comes to America with Designs for the Order in New York.

A Man who seeks Enlightenment shall set himself in Motion:

He shall show Appreciation for the Exertions of his Fellows,
And make as a Church-Going Man does before Holy Symbols.

He shall show Great Disdain for the Trappings of Old Empire,
And avert his Gaze from schemes Coiled and Chaotic.

**That is why the sailors continue to hound me. They will stop at nothing to acquire the plans.
For this reason they have been divided and concealed.**

I declare that I have [3] children now living whose names and birth dates are:

**Various powerful factions want us off Solomon Island, but I have gone to great lengths —
and spent great sums — to secure our site. It is ours and it is perfect for its purpose.**

January 19th, 1881

Beaumont cam by for supper.

Though I am beginning to suspect his intentions for visiting so often, he remains pleasant company [covered] He makes my dear Joanna [covered]

He makes my dear [covered]

I had the [covered] in a fever. I can still hear the terrible whispers that beckon one into the deep…

Beaumont called at the house this morning after breakfast, and asked to speak with me in private. He again insisted to be brought down into the mines to speak with the men; he appeared upset, and began to shout. This time, I refused him and he left in a hurry. Joanna berated me for being a poor host. I feat she has developed feelings for him.


[attached note:]

Frank R. Devore
The Devore Mansion
Solomon Island

Devore founded the Blue Ridge in 1876. found guilty of murdering his wife Joanna in October 1881. Sentenced to death by hanging. Associated with individual named 'Beaumont'. Numerous references to this person in diary. Connected to other mentions of Beaumont in Solomon Island history? Diary also references important papers regarding Blue Ridge Mine located in mansion, but papers appear to have been hidden. Our agents have been unable to retrieve. Devore Mansion has recently been sold to E. Franklin.

## Tier 1/3

Sequence One

    5 25 29 85 89 ??

Answer: 145

Reason: take the sum of the squares of the previous term. So:

    5^2 = 25
    2^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 24 = 29
    2^2 + 9^2 = 4 + 81 = 85
    8^2 + 5^2 = 64 + 25 = 89
    8^2 + 9^2 = 64 + 81 = 145

-----

Sequence Two

    1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45

Answer: 55

Reason: add sequential integers to current value to get new value:

    1 + 2 = 3
    3 + 3 = 6
    6 + 4 = 10
    10 + 5 = 15
    15 + 6 = 21
    21 + 7 = 28
    28 + 8 = 36
    36 + 9 = 45
    45 + 10 = 55

-----

Sequence Three

    1011011001 1000000000 101010111

Answer: 11011000

Reason: reverse cubed root in binary

    729 512 343
    9^3 = 729
    8^3 = 512
    7^3 = 343
    6^3 = 216 = 11011000

Sequence Four

    312213 212223 114213 31121314 41122314 31221324

Answer: 21322314

Reason: summarize the numbers of the previous entry in numerical order:

    312213 => two 1s, two 2s, two 3s = 212223
    212223 => one 1s, four 2s, one 3s = 114213
    114213 => three 1s, one 2s, one 3s, one 4s = 31121314
    31121314 => four 1s, one 2s, two 3s, one 4s = 41122314
    41122314 => three 1s, two 2s, one 3s, two 4s = 31221324
    31221324 => two 1s, three 2s, two 3s, one 4s = 21322314

## Tier 2/3

Sequence One

    42 66 70 78 102 105

Answer: 110

Reason: sphenic numbers, product of three distinct primes in numerical order:

    2 * 3 * 7 = 42
    2 * 3 * 11 = 66
    2 * 5 * 7 = 70
    2 * 3 * 13 = 78
    2 * 3 * 17 = 102
    3 * 5 * 7 = 105
    2 * 5 * 11 = 110

-----

Sequence Two

    2 3 3 5 10 13 39 43 172 177

Answer: 885

Reason: add 1, multiply by 1, add 2, multiply by 2 ... :

    2 + 1 = 3
    3 * 1 = 3
    3 + 2 = 5
    5 * 2 = 10
    10 + 3 = 13
    13 * 3 = 39
    39 + 4 = 43
    43 * 4 = 172
    172 + 5 = 177
    177 * 5 = 885

-----

Sequence Three (emirps)

    13 17 31 37 71 73 79 97 107

Answer: 113

Reason: Emirps are prime numbers whose palindrome is a different prime:

    13 => 31
    17 => 71
    31 => 13
    71 => 17
    73 => 37
    79 => 97
    97 => 79
    107 => 701
    113 => 311

Sequence Four

    377 610 987 1597

Answer: 2584

Reason: Fibonacci.

    610 + 377 = 987
    987 + 610 = 1597
    1597 + 987 = 2584

The important bits are the numbers (6744) and the location (pits of fire). Although to be honest, "pits of fire" sounds more like the Scorched Flats, but I suppose it does say he travelled across them. The final location is a locked box at about (505, 1010).

## Tier 2/3

`My surname is common in classic literature. And my clearance level is the key.`

His clearance level is goldbug, and his surname is Glass.

Edgar Allen Poe wrote a short story called "The Gold Bug", in which a man finds a gold "scarab-like" bug and an encrypted message leading him to the treasure of Captain Kidd. The message was encrypted with a substitution cypher:

    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    52-†81346,709*‡.$();?¶]¢:[

(From [Gold-Bug Cipher - Decoder, Encoder, Solver, Translator](http://www.dcode.fr/gold-bug-poe))

The Field Director's surname is Glass, so that would be translated as:

    305))

This can also be found on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold-Bug), as the text "glass" appears in the message from the short story.

The gods whose names start with same letter will follow one after the other. (ref. Book of Going Forth By Day)

Neither of the southern gods shall lead the procession, or end it

Horus comes before Satis, but after Ma'at (ref. Book of Gates)

The final god in the procession has a longer name than the two previous gods

            EAST
    
        1          4
    Meretseger   Ma'at
        2          5
     Sekhmet     Bast
        3          6
      Horus      Satis


Procession Order:

1. Meretseger
2. Ma'at
3. Horus
4. Bast
5. Satis
6. Sekhmet

To find Anubis head east out of the courtyard, drop off the edge and turn around. He's behind the door.

The password hint is "Horse Feathers". [Horse Feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_Feathers) is a Marx Brothers film from 1932, in which a password is `swordfish`. So that's probably the origin of that.

# Halls of Lost Records

There is an achievement to not get hit during this mission. It's nuts, especially with the forced combat. Most of the shades you can sneak past.

**Do not touch the blue beams in any way.**

Four rooms, mostly obvious. There is one chamber where you have to kill a filth beast. It's not fun if you're going for the achievement. Use the grenades to stun it, damage it until it wakes up, repeat. (I'm guessing here, since I wasn't able to do that.) Very high dps would probably be useful.

Sekhmet - this place sucks. *Be very careful entering this room:* There are four shades, two of them patrolling right by the entrance. You need to trigger one of the four devices (possibly far right?) on the wall in the corners of the room to enable the rotating smaller devices around the center. After that it's just like the last chamber (hah!) excpet for the patrolling shades: aim the surrounding devices toward the larger device in the center of the room. Watch out for the two wandering shades (just take your time, follow their pathing if you have to) and the blue laser beams, and also don't stand in their death explosions after triggering the defenses.

That's the final room. Once you have the key, teleport back to Ptahmose and hand in the quest.

# Emergency Procedures

*Achievement*: do not be seen.

Use the generator by the tent. It'll send the drone out to fix it. (In TSW you could also jump over the barriers in the tent, but the drone's awareness circle seems to be a lot bigger now.)

Need password for Himura's computer. [Apparently](http://legacy.tswdb.com/missions/city-of-the-sun-god/emergency-procedures) 1981. The only place I remember seeing this was in the tent in the area north of Lisa Hui.

> (Lost the narrative here, I'm afraid. Several stanzas. Something about the feather of Maat. Also two lovers. Tragic endings. A fish coming up from the dried ground -<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">lungfish?</span>- and so on. But keyed back in on another possible location below.)

> We came to a place.<br>

# The Voice of Klein

* First recording - entrance of the Ankh (solo instance)
* Second recording - behind a pillar, just down teh first stairs (to the murder ball)
* Third recording - behind some crates on the right side of the ramp down after the murder ball (don't forget to suck up the tremor with the device to get to the next room)
* Fourth recording - turn right after the ramp, at the end of the first alcove (second alcove has lore)
* Fifth recording - on a desk on the other side of the room after the fight with Klein (only use the device to absorb the larger attacks, when they encircle you)

# The Binding

## Tier 7/10

They're [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_numerals).

    𓏺 = 1
    𓎆 = 10
    𓏲 = 100
    𓆼 = 1000
    𓂻 and 𓂽 are + and -, depending

Addition and subtraction depend on the direction of the text. Feet pointing in the direction of the text flow is interpreted as addition, feet pointed opposite is subtraction.

So for the north wall (assuming L2R):

    𓍧𓎋𓎆𓏿𓂻𓍧𓎈𓏽

becomes:

    676 - 634 = 42

which is:

    𓎉𓏻

So the correct hieroglyph is the right-most symbol on the left side when looking at the north face of the pyramid.

# Death and Axes

## Tier 1/5

> Mihail Sasu a fost găsit mort, spânzurat de gât. A fost chemat un comisar de poliție de la Cluj. Numele lui este Ioan Pătrașcu. Nu așa merg lucrurile în Harbaburești. Spune-i lui Pătrașcu numai ceea ce trebuie spus și dă-i viteză. După aceea o să ne ocupăm de traba asta așa cum știm noi. De vreme ce spiritui bietului băiat se tot învârte pe aici, l-am putea întreba ce își amintește. Dacă este tulburat, îi vom aduce pacea. Dacă arată cu degetul, vom face dreptate.

Romanian, translates to:

> Mihail Sasu was found dead, hanged by the neck. A police commissioner from Cluj was called. His name is John Patrascu. That's not how things work in Harburesti. Only tell Patrascu what he has to say and give him speed [what he wants to hear to get him to leave?]. Then we'll deal with this trap as we know. Since the poor boy's spirit is still spinning around here, we might ask him what he remembers. If he is troubled, we will bring him peace. If he shows his finger, we will be right.

Type `Mihail Sasu` into the computer:
  
    Bacaș County local. No criminal record, no driver's license. Previous address: Harbaburești, 106.
    
    New entry: body was discovered at location 1000, 695 on local map.

Head to (1000, 695).

Letter:

> Sophie,

> Noaptea târziu, când dormi, spiritele vorbesc prin gura ta. Nu vorbest despre lucruri bune. Asemenea orori nu-și au locul pe chipul tău dulce. Haide să fugim împreună. Departe de secretele acestui oraș și de accastă vale a stafiilor.

> Am lucrat pe cămpul Olaru în acest week-end, alături de părinții tăi. Mă plac suficient de mult. Nu am indrăznit să le spun că sper să te răpesc.

> Vino la fermă cu mine, duminică. Pot fi curajos. Le voi spune despre viitorul pe care vreau să-l construiesc alături de tine, la oraș. Nu vrei să vii?

> Mihail.

Well this is rough:

> Sophie,

> Late night when you sleep, spirits talk through your mouth. He did not talk about good things. Such horrors have no place on your sweet face. Let's run together. Far from the secrets of this city and the valley of the valley.

> I've been working on the Olaru field this weekend with your parents. I like enough. I did not dare tell them I hope to kidnap you.

> Come to the farm with me on Sunday. I can be brave. I'll tell them about the future I want to build with you, the city. Do not you want to come?

> Michael.

Possibly this is better:

> Sophie

> Late at night while you sleep, spirits speak through your mouth. They do not say good things. Such horrors have no place on your sweet face. Let's run away together. Far from the secrets of this city and this valley of ghosts.

> I've been working in the Olaru fields this weekend with your parents. I like them. I did not dare tell them I hope to leave with you.

> Come to the farm with me on Sunday. I will be brave. I'll tell them about the future I want to build with you, in the city. Will you come?

## Tier 5/5

The journal:

(There may be a couple of mistakes in this, although using google translate to proofread a language I don't know is… probably incorrect. Whatever. I think the second sentence of the first paragraph may actually be `aşează` instead of `aşază`, and in the last sentence `a conduș` instead of `a condus`. That second change makes the translation make far more sense as it changes from "when he led the parade" to "when she lead the parade", and we're talking about a female subject (Sophie). Similar change in p.3: `s-o` to `ș-o` changes "he" to "she".)

*Original*

> Am ştiut întotdeauna că sălbăticia o iubeşte. Spiritele se aşază în jurul ei precum câinii lângă foc. Însă anul acesta, când, a condus pâparuda, mi-am dat seama că și eu o iubesc.

> Am găsit scrisorile fratelui meu. Scrisori către ea. Chiar trebuie oare să ne întrcein la toate? Atunci aşa să fie - şi fie ca cel mai bun dintre noi să-i afle numele adevărat.

> Lumina din ochii ei a strălucit pentru o clipă, apoi a pierit. A încercat ș-o ascundă, însă am știut. M-a luat drept el. L-u ales pe el.

> Dacă eu nu o pot avea, de ce să o aibă el?

> Nu așa mi-am închipuit eu. Deloc nu mi-am închipuit așa. Să mă întorc singur de pe podul îndrăgostiților. Să mă întorc criminal.

> Păsările negre se stăng la fereastra mea. Dacă adorm, o să-mi scoată ochii.

> A venit un polițist de la oraș. Păsările negre mi-au spus-o în clipocitul apei din uluci.

> Râzând ca țevile de scurgere, azi-noapt m-au dus la fermă. Păcătuiesc iar și iar. Nu are un gust sărat, ci dulce. Dulce ca otrava de șoboiani.

> Dacă eu nu o pot avea, de ce să o aibă altcineva?

> Polițistul știe că eu am fost. Se joacă cu mine așa [asa?] cum o pasăre neagră încoițește sărmanul miel. Nu va muri în somn, ca ceilalți.

> Bolboroselile întunericului, iureșul iubiților și fraților morți. Îmi spune să aduc polițistul. Adu-l acolo unde a început ura mea.

*Translation*

> I always knew the wilderness loved her. Spirits sit around like the dogs near the fire. But this year, when she led the parade, I realized I also loved her.

> I found my brother's letters. Letters to her. Do we really have to go to everything? Then be it - and be the best of us to find out his true name.

> Light shone in her eyes for a moment, then died. She tried to hide it, but I knew. He took it to him. You chose him.

> If I can not have it, why should he have it?

> That's not what I imagined. At least I did not think so. Let me turn myself off the bridge of the lovers. Let me go back to murder.

> The black birds sit at my window. If I fall asleep, he'll take my eyes off.

> There was a city policeman. The black birds told me in the blink of water in the dungeons.

> Laughing like the drain pipes, they took me to the farm today. I sin again and again. It does not taste salty but sweet. Sweet like the pox of the owls.

(Say what? Didn't know owl pox was sweet. I believe this is alluding to the deaths of Sophie's parents at Olaru Farm.)

> If I can not have it, why else have it?

(Another winner.)

> The cop knows I was. He plays with me as a black bird clings to the poor lamb. He will not die in the sleep, like the others.

> The mournfulness of darkness, the joy of beloved and dead brothers. He tells me to bring the cop. Bring it where my hate started.

And I believe all that means go back to the bridge over Lover's Creek, "where my hate started."

So. Periodic table of elements, and then probably weights to letters, A=1, B=2, etc. So with this:

$input = "F HKNaBBe CaOB PMgBe BeArFSiNaBArK HCa CaOB CaHTiBArSiH HHePScCa AlMn CHCaOBAr. KPAlB ArBAlBAlHeBArBBe, ArBLiHMgMgBBe OB KSBSiCa SiFNOCaK VFCaO OFK MgPLiHMg AlFKCaArBKK CaOBArB.

    # check for lowercase and increment counter if found
    if ($i < strlen($input) - 1 && preg_match('/[a-z]/', $input[$i + 1]) == 1) $symbol .= $input[++$i];

    $output .= chr(array_search($symbol, $table) + 65);
  }

You get this:

So off we go to check the tavern rooms. Camera III in particular.

> There is a message written within us all. My research is understanding the meaning of this message written between 45477804 to 45481340.

> The link is here, and to understand my research, you need to understand the link.

The "message written within us all" is probably DNA, so search for dna 45477804 45481340 and you get [this technical page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/phegeni?chr=1&from=45477804&to=45481340&fromto=45477804+45481340&tab=0#pgGTEX). Looking under the eQTL section, the only gene that appears is [UROD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7389) which is another technical page (it's the NIH, it's supposed to be). The summary says that mutations in this gene are known to cause "familial porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoetic porphyria". So… [`porphyria`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria).

          SUPERIUS'
        SICUT
      'INFERNUS                 SUB
     DIXIT                       MAXIMUS
      FLEVIT                    ARBOR
          ILLE

Interestingly, google gives different translations depending on the case:

`ille flevit dixit 'infernus sicut superius'` is `He wept said, 'Hell, just above'`, while `ille flevit dixit 'Infernus sicut superius'` is `He wept, said, "With the above '` (including the weird non-matching quotes and trailing space.) All uppercase `ILLE FLEVIT DIXIT 'INFERNUS SICUT SUPERIUS'` becomes `HE wept said a "hell as described above '` so I think some work may need to be done on the Latin translator, although which version of latin to use is a question (classical latin has no letter case, but medieval latin does.)

I think the message may be intended to be `Under the oldest tree he wept, saying, "As above, so below."` or something similar.

In any case, go around to the back of the big tree in the park (you'll see a message saying the leaves whisper when you're in the right spot) and /cry. And as you cry below, so the tree cries above. With leaves. Then glowing. Follow follow.

## Tier 3/3

Two coins for the ferryman, and I guess we're stabbing people in the mouth now. To be fair, he wasn't a nice man.

    Venus and Mercury in their courses; in the lowest sphere the Moon revolves, lighted by the rays of the sun.

There is a map of the earth on the door at the far end of the room, so we'll call that Earth, the fourth brazier back from that is larger than the others, so we'll call that the Sun. That leaves three braziers in between the Earth and the Sun, which fits the clue (Venus, Mercury, and the Moon.)

Venus, Mercury, the Moon, and the Sun. Light 'em up. `Venus and Mercury in their courses`, so [Mercury first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System), then Venus, `in the lowest sphere the Moon revolves` so it's next, `lighted by the rays of the sun` making it last. At least I think that's the logic. Marking the brazier closest the map door as `1`, the order is `3-2-1-4`.

A fight in an investigation mission? Unpossible. Stand near the portal at the end of the room as much as you can (possibly beating the guardian down will temporarily stop him? Didn't notice.) until the portal opens and the guardian disappears.
