# Something Wicked

City Hall second floor filing cabinet. Q3 2002. Then it's off to the police station to check on the file of Larry Checkon. And then `/reset`.

While still deaad, you can see a white raven on top of a squad car outside the police station. It will fly off; follow it.

    One for sorrow
    Two for joy
    Three for a girl
    Four for a boy
    Five for silver
    Six for gold
    Seven for a secret, never to be told.

* 6 - gold
* 3 - girl
* 1 - sorrow
* 7 - secrets

# Digging Deeper

## Tier 1

*Clavis Aurea* is "gold key" in latin. Or possibly "key of gold". "Golden key"? Doesn't matter. There's a giant key to the city in the back room of the second floor of the town hall which, unbelievably, fits this lock.

## Tier 2

*Oculus, rara avis*

Eye, rare bird.

Solomon Priest's Tomb

A CONFESSION,
penned in the Year under the Eye 1702,
Kingsmouth Town

One night consider this an Admission to two Acts of Cowardice, and also of bad Faith within the Enlightened Order, and as such I shall see to it that this Missive, once written, is sequestered with my own Corpse. My Time on this Earth runs short, and Much is left to be Undertaken; by this I mean the Order, and by our Third, but more on that Apiece.

The Remains of Solomon Priest were moved at my Instruction, by Loyal Men, who fashioned for him a new Rest within the Tunnels. On this matter I declare my Reasoning was to prevent our Enemies and Consorts alike from Digging too Deeply. The trail to the new Tomb shall die with my Retainers and my Self, and so too shall die any Looter or Gawker seeking to negotiate its Traps, should they not hold Enlightened Knowledge.

A Man who seeks Enlightenment shall set himself in Motion:

He shall show Appreciation for the Exertions of his Fellows,
And make as a Church-Going Man does before Holy Symbols.

He shall show Great Disdain for the Trappings of Old Empire,
And avert his Gaze from schemes Coiled and Chaotic.

### Notes

Confession part Two

To the Second Part, then, the reason for this Deception is that I did take the man's life, all true, I did Poison him as the Rumours have long circulated, and likely shall Continue. For truly it was less an act of urder as of Martyring, and though I assumed his Duries I perform them with Hollow Ritual, and as his Name is remembered, mine remains in his considerable Shadow. In the one score of Years since my Fateful Act, I have come to accept this was always my Rightful Place, and in seeking to Unseat him, I did only Seal it so Forevermore.

The Third knew of my Treachery, of this I am Certain, even though he remained in London; now finally, as I breathe my last, he comes to America with Designs for the Order in New York.

January 19th, 1881

Beaumont came by for supper.

Though I am beginning to suspect his intentions for visiting so often, he remains pleasant company [covered] He makes my dear Joanna [covered]

He makes my dear [covered]

I had the [covered] in a fever. I can still hear the terrible whispers that beckon one into the deep…

Beaumont called at the house this morning after breakfast, and asked to speak with me in private. He again insisted to be brought down into the mines to speak with the men; he appeared upset, and began to shout. This time, I refused him and he left in a hurry. Joanna berated me for being a poor host. I feat she has developed feelings for him.


[attached note:]

Frank R. Devore
The Devore Mansion
Solomon Island

Devore founded the Blue Ridge in 1876. found guilty of murdering his wife Joanna in October 1881. Sentenced to death by hanging. Associated with individual named 'Beaumont'. Numerous references to this person in diary. Connected to other mentions of Beaumont in Solomon Island history? Diary also references important papers regarding Blue Ridge Mine located in mansion, but papers appear to have been hidden. Our agents have been unable to retrieve. Devore Mansion has recently been sold to E. Franklin.

Last Will and Testament **bold text read through red glass from ferris wheel and monocle from Bogeyman**

I, [Nathaniel Harvey Winter], of [112 Bishop Street, Boston, Mass.], being of sound mind, do hereby<br>
**The ingenious design was acquired from a very rare architect at great cost**<br>
revoke all previous wills and codicils made by me, and publish and declare the following to be my<br>
**I outbid the sailors for it on a steamship to Cairo.**<br>
Last Will and Testament.<br>
**The design was worth every penny — I attest the mechanics work.**

I declare that I am married to [Elizabeth Rachel Knox]

**That is why the sailors continue to hound me. They will stop at nothing to acquire the plans.
For this reason they have been divided and concealed.**

I declare that I have [3] children now living whose names and birth dates are:

**Various powerful factions want us off Solomon Island, but I have gone to great lengths —
and spent great sums — to secure our site. It is ours and it is perfect for its purpose.**

[Madeline Winter, May 15th, 1981]

[Nicholas Winter, November 7th 1985]

**Only a small piece of Henderson's farm remains.**

I appoint [Harden Ogilvy] to be sole executor of this will and I give to [my son, Nicholas Winter]<br>
**Son, if you are reading this, I can only assume you have inherited something essential from me.**<br>
all my real and personal property whatsoever and wheresoever.<br>
**I dare not reduce it to a name.**

In witness of which I have set my hand to this my will this [23rd] day of [March, 1980].<br>
Testaor signature: [Nathaniel Winter]

## Tier 1

Inside the barn south of Nathaniel Winter.

## Tier 2

Wearing the clear lens, pick up part two of the plans on the south side of the fence surrounding the bumbper cars. Follow the lit path to the ferris wheel, where a pile of red glass is on the ground. Grab that, and you can now read part two.

## Tier 3

While making your way to the Octotron, there is a pile of blue glass in front of a bingo cola machine. Also don't miss picking up part three of Winter's Plan, posted to a shed just west of the ride.

## Tier 4

South from the Octotron with the blue lens, heading toward the roller coaster. And there's the next part of the plans heading up the ramp.

## Tier 5

Use both the red and blue glass to make purple. That's how light works.

Just run the parts backward. I remember this being much more difficult.

# Win Win

## Tier 1/3

Sequence One

    5 25 29 85 89 ??

Answer: 145

Reason: take the sum of the squares of the previous term. So:

    5^2 = 25
    2^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 25 = 29
    2^2 + 9^2 = 4 + 81 = 85
    8^2 + 5^2 = 64 + 25 = 89
    8^2 + 9^2 = 64 + 81 = 145

-----

Sequence Two

    1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45

Answer: 55

Reason: add sequential integers to current value to get new value:

    1 + 2 = 3
    3 + 3 = 6
    6 + 4 = 10
    10 + 5 = 15
    15 + 6 = 21
    21 + 7 = 28
    28 + 8 = 36
    36 + 9 = 45
    45 + 10 = 55

-----

Sequence Three

    1011011001 1000000000 101010111

Answer: 11011000

Reason: reverse cubed root in binary

    729 512 343
    9^3 = 729
    8^3 = 512
    7^3 = 343
    6^3 = 216 = 11011000

-----

Sequence Four

    312213 212223 114213 31121314 41122314 31221324

Answer: 21322314

Reason: summarize the numbers of the previous entry in numerical order:

    312213 => two 1s, two 2s, two 3s = 212223
    212223 => one 1s, four 2s, one 3s = 114213
    114213 => three 1s, one 2s, one 3s, one 4s = 31121314
    31121314 => four 1s, one 2s, two 3s, one 4s = 41122314
    41122314 => three 1s, two 2s, one 3s, two 4s = 31221324
    31221324 => two 1s, three 2s, two 3s, one 4s = 21322314

## Tier 2/3

Sequence One

    42 66 70 78 102 105

Answer: 110

Reason: sphenic numbers, product of three distinct primes in numerical order:

    2 * 3 * 7 = 42
    2 * 3 * 11 = 66
    2 * 5 * 7 = 70
    2 * 3 * 13 = 78
    2 * 3 * 17 = 102
    3 * 5 * 7 = 105
    2 * 5 * 11 = 110

-----

Sequence Two

    2 3 3 5 10 13 39 43 172 177

Answer: 885

Reason: add 1, multiply by 1, add 2, multiply by 2 ... :

    2 + 1 = 3
    3 * 1 = 3
    3 + 2 = 5
    5 * 2 = 10
    10 + 3 = 13
    13 * 3 = 39
    39 + 4 = 43
    43 * 4 = 172
    172 + 5 = 177
    177 * 5 = 885

-----

Sequence Three (emirps)

    13 17 31 37 71 73 79 97 107

Answer: 113

Reason: Emirps are prime numbers whose palindrome is a different prime:

    13 => 31
    17 => 71
    31 => 13
    37 => 73
    71 => 17
    73 => 37
    79 => 97
    97 => 79
    107 => 701
    113 => 311

-----

Sequence Four

    377 610 987 1597

Answer: 2584

Reason: Fibonacci.

    610 + 377 = 987
    987 + 610 = 1597
    1597 + 987 = 2584

The important bits are the numbers (6744) and the location (pits of fire). Although to be honest, "pits of fire" sounds more like the Scorched Flats, but I suppose it does say he travelled across them. The final location is a locked box at about (505, 1010).

## Tier 2/3

`My surname is common in classic literature. And my clearance level is the key.`

His clearance level is goldbug, and his surname is Glass.

Edgar Allen Poe wrote a short story called "The Gold Bug", in which a man finds a gold "scarab-like" bug and an encrypted message leading him to the treasure of Captain Kidd. The message was encrypted with a substitution cypher:

    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    52-†81346,709*‡.$();?¶]¢:[

(From [Gold-Bug Cipher - Decoder, Encoder, Solver, Translator](http://www.dcode.fr/gold-bug-poe))

The Field Director's surname is Glass, so that would be translated as:

    305))

This can also be found on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold-Bug), as the text "glass" appears in the message from the short story.

The gods whose names start with same letter will follow one after the other. (ref. Book of Going Forth By Day)

Neither of the southern gods shall lead the procession, or end it

Horus comes before Satis, but after Ma'at (ref. Book of Gates)

The final god in the procession has a longer name than the two previous gods

            EAST
    
        1          4
    Meretseger   Ma'at
        2          5
     Sekhmet     Bast
        3          6
      Horus      Satis


Procession Order:

1. Meretseger
2. Ma'at
3. Horus
4. Bast
5. Satis
6. Sekhmet

To find Anubis head east out of the courtyard, drop off the edge and turn around. He's behind the door.

The password hint is "Horse Feathers". [Horse Feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_Feathers) is a Marx Brothers film from 1932, in which a password is `swordfish`. So that's probably the origin of that.

# Halls of Lost Records

Well this got a lot easier. The achievement is now just to not be seen by Transformed Orochi Soldiers. No combat, just sneaking. And it's not even in darkness, so all the monsters are completely visible.

<del>There is an achievement to not get hit during this mission. It's nuts, especially with the forced combat. Most of the shades you can sneak past.</del>

<del>**Do not touch the blue beams in any way.**</del>

<del>Four rooms, mostly obvious. There is one chamber where you have to kill a filth beast. It's not fun if you're going for the achievement. Use the grenades to stun it, damage it until it wakes up, repeat. (I'm guessing here, since I wasn't able to do that.) Very high dps would probably be useful.</del>

<del>Sekhmet - this place sucks. *Be very careful entering this room:* There are four shades, two of them patrolling right by the entrance. You need to trigger one of the four devices (possibly far right?) on the wall in the corners of the room to enable the rotating smaller devices around the center. After that it's just like the last chamber (hah!) except for the patrolling shades: aim the surrounding devices toward the larger device in the center of the room. Watch out for the two wandering shades (just take your time, follow their pathing if you have to) and the blue laser beams, and also don't stand in their death explosions after triggering the defenses.</del>

<del>That's the final room. Once you have the key, teleport back to Ptahmose and hand in the quest.</del>

# Emergency Procedures

*Achievement*: do not be seen.

Use the generator by the tent. It'll send the drone out to fix it. (In TSW you could also jump over the barriers in the tent, but the drone's awareness circle seems to be a lot bigger now.)

Need password for Himura's computer. [Apparently](http://legacy.tswdb.com/missions/city-of-the-sun-god/emergency-procedures) 1981. The only place I remember seeing this was in the tent in the area north of Lisa Hui for the Prometheus Initiative.

Pick up the data from the laptop in the tent by the entrance.

Second laptop: In front of a tent with a security camera to the north. Jump over the air conditioner for the first tent and head towards the filth pool. North slightly, and turn right, there's two tents, each with cameras, and a patrolling drone. Watch the timing.

Third laptop: in an open tent just north of the second laptop. You get stuck on a lot of geometry in this one. Using the laptop causes it to break.

Laptop parts: retrace your steps in reverse, as you'll want to head north along the eastern cliff face to get to the air conditioning unit of the north-most tent. *Do not beam out,* unless you don't care about the achievement. After disabling the air conditioner wait for the drones to pass and head into the tent (watch out for the camera above the door.) There are three parts: one just ahead of you, the other two in the right half of the tent. One to the north, one to the south. Exit the tent (still watching out for the camera) and follow the eastern cliff face back to the start. After that make your way back to the third laptop, fix it, and finish.

If doing the achievement Due Diligence, find the third tremor, do not enter the Ankh after listening to the recording. Instead, place the device and collect a tremor. Return to the Oxford expedition tent and deliver the recording, then continue to find the fourth anomaly. You will get the achievement upon inspecting the seismograph after delivering the fourth recording.

# The Voice of Klein

* First recording - entrance of the Ankh (solo instance)
* Second recording - behind a pillar, just down the first stairs (to the murder ball)
* Third recording - behind some crates on the right side of the ramp down after the murder ball (don't forget to suck up the tremor with the device to get to the next room)
* Fourth recording - turn right after the ramp, at the end of the first alcove (second alcove has lore)
* Fifth recording - on a desk on the other side of the room after the fight with Klein (only use the device to absorb the larger attacks, when they encircle you)

# The Binding

## Tier 7/10

They're [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_numerals).

    𓏺 = 1
    𓎆 = 10
    𓏲 = 100
    𓆼 = 1000
    𓂻 and 𓂽 are + and -, depending

Addition and subtraction depend on the direction of the text. Feet pointing in the direction of the text flow is interpreted as addition, feet pointed opposite is subtraction.

So for the north wall (assuming L2R):

    𓍧𓎋𓎆𓏿𓂻𓍧𓎈𓏽

becomes:

    676 - 634 = 42

which is:

    𓎉𓏻

So the correct hieroglyph is the right-most symbol on the left side when looking at the north face of the pyramid.

## Tier 8/10

From left to right: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutenkhamen (the raven outside gave the clue.)

# Death and Axes

## Tier 1/5

After killing yourself and listening to the ghost beside Sophie say his name (Ioan Patrascu), head up to his room (the register on the counter behind the bar says he's stayin in "camera 1", which is "room 1"). Read the note on the dresser.

> Mihail Sasu a fost găsit mort, spânzurat de gât. A fost chemat un comisar de poliție de la Cluj. Numele lui este Ioan Pătrașcu. Nu așa merg lucrurile în Harbaburești. Spune-i lui Pătrașcu numai ceea ce trebuie spus și dă-i viteză. După aceea o să ne ocupăm de traba asta așa cum știm noi. De vreme ce spiritui bietului băiat se tot învârte pe aici, l-am putea întreba ce își amintește. Dacă este tulburat, îi vom aduce pacea. Dacă arată cu degetul, vom face dreptate.

Romanian, translates to:

> Mihail Sasu was found dead, hanged by the neck. A police commissioner from Cluj was called. His name is John Patrascu. That's not how things work in Harbaburesti. Only tell Patrascu what he has to say and give him speed [what he wants to hear to get him to leave?]. Then we'll deal with this trap as we know. Since the poor boy's spirit is still spinning around here, we might ask him what he remembers. If he is troubled, we will bring him peace. If he shows his finger, we will be right.

Type `Mihail Sasu` into the computer:
  
    Bacaș County local. No criminal record, no driver's license. Previous address: Harbaburești, 106.
    
    New entry: body was discovered at location 1000, 695 on local map.
    
    New entry: non-smoker.

Head to (1000, 695).

> Noaptea târziu, când dormi, spiritele vorbesc prin gura ta. Nu vorbest despre lucruri bune. Asemenea orori nu-și au locul pe chipul tău dulce. Haide să fugim împreună. Departe de secretele acestui oraș și de accastă vale a stafiilor.
> 
> Am lucrat pe cămpul Olaru în acest week-end, alături de părinții tăi. Mă plac suficient de mult. Nu am indrăznit să le spun că sper să te răpesc.
> 
> Vino la fermă cu mine, duminică. Pot fi curajos. Le voi spune despre viitorul pe care vreau să-l construiesc alături de tine, la oraș. Nu vrei să vii?

> Mihail.

Well this is rough:

> Sophie,
> 
> Late night when you sleep, spirits talk through your mouth. He did not talk about good things. Such horrors have no place on your sweet face. Let's run together. Far from the secrets of this city and the valley of the valley.
> 
> I've been working on the Olaru field this weekend with your parents. I like enough. I did not dare tell them I hope to kidnap you.
> 
> Come to the farm with me on Sunday. I can be brave. I'll tell them about the future I want to build with you, the city. Do not you want to come?
> 
> Michael.

Possibly this is better:

> Sophie
> 
> Late at night while you sleep, spirits speak through your mouth. They do not say good things. Such horrors have no place on your sweet face. Let's run away together. Far from the secrets of this city and this valley of ghosts.
> 
> I've been working in the Olaru fields this weekend with your parents. I like them. I did not dare tell them I hope to leave with you.
> 
> Come to the farm with me on Sunday. I will be brave. I'll tell them about the future I want to build with you, in the city. Will you come?
> 
> Michael.

## Tier 3/5

Head to Olaru Farm and find the bodies (body parts?) of Sophie's mother and father. Her father is in the road being eaten by a couple of werewolves, her mother is closer to the fields. In pieces. After interacting with them, you must be dead to hear their clues, so `/reset` and run back.

> father's clue: `VL`

> mother's clue: `159`

The order is `VL159`. It's a license plate.

## Tier 4/5

Back at Patrascu's hotel room, enter `VL159` into the laptop.

    Rental car. Involved in speeding offense in Bistrita.
    
    New entry: recently rented by Mr VAVILA, Dvidiu STOLOJAN, Mr SASU, Sanziana BRUMAREL, Mr BUIKOVIC.

black (brunette) hair, drinking, glasses. Suspect: Aron Sasu.

    Bacaș County local. Expired driver's license on record, no current address given.
    
    Criminal record: restraining order filed against Sasu in Harbaburești.

Into the village and find Aron standing in front of the door to 106 Whatever road this is (1089, 1112). Accuse and fight!

## Tier 5/5

The journal:

(There may be a couple of mistakes in this, although using google translate to proofread a language I don't know is… probably incorrect. Whatever. I think the second sentence of the first paragraph may actually be `aşează` instead of `aşază`, and in the last sentence `a conduș` instead of `a condus`. That second change makes the translation make far more sense as it changes from "when he led the parade" to "when she lead the parade", and we're talking about a female subject (Sophie). Similar change in p.3: `s-o` to `ș-o` changes "he" to "she".)

*Original*

> Am ştiut întotdeauna că sălbăticia o iubeşte. Spiritele se aşază în jurul ei precum câinii lângă foc. Însă anul acesta, când, a condus pâparuda, mi-am dat seama că și eu o iubesc.
> 
> Am găsit scrisorile fratelui meu. Scrisori către ea. Chiar trebuie oare să ne întrcein la toate? Atunci aşa să fie - şi fie ca cel mai bun dintre noi să-i afle numele adevărat.
> 
> Lumina din ochii ei a strălucit pentru o clipă, apoi a pierit. A încercat ș-o ascundă, însă am știut. M-a luat drept el. L-u ales pe el.
> 
> Dacă eu nu o pot avea, de ce să o aibă el?
> 
> Nu așa mi-am închipuit eu. Deloc nu mi-am închipuit așa. Să mă întorc singur de pe podul îndrăgostiților. Să mă întorc criminal.
> 
> Păsările negre se stăng la fereastra mea. Dacă adorm, o să-mi scoată ochii.
> 
> A venit un polițist de la oraș. Păsările negre mi-au spus-o în clipocitul apei din uluci.
> 
> Râzând ca țevile de scurgere, azi-noapt m-au dus la fermă. Păcătuiesc iar și iar. Nu are un gust sărat, ci dulce. Dulce ca otrava de șoboiani.
> 
> Dacă eu nu o pot avea, de ce să o aibă altcineva?
> 
> Polițistul știe că eu am fost. Se joacă cu mine așa [asa?] cum o pasăre neagră încoițește sărmanul miel. Nu va muri în somn, ca ceilalți.
> 
> Bolboroselile întunericului, iureșul iubiților și fraților morți. Îmi spune să aduc polițistul. Adu-l acolo unde a început ura mea.

*Translation*

> I always knew the wilderness loved her. Spirits sit around like the dogs near the fire. But this year, when she led the parade, I realized I also loved her.
> 
> I found my brother's letters. Letters to her. Do we really have to go to everything? Then be it - and be the best of us to find out his true name.
> 
> Light shone in her eyes for a moment, then died. She tried to hide it, but I knew. He took it to him. You chose him.
> 
> If I can not have it, why should he have it?
> 
> That's not what I imagined. At least I did not think so. Let me turn myself off the bridge of the lovers. Let me go back to murder.
> 
> The black birds sit at my window. If I fall asleep, he'll take my eyes off.
> 
> There was a city policeman. The black birds told me in the blink of water in the dungeons.
> 
> Laughing like the drain pipes, they took me to the farm today. I sin again and again. It does not taste salty but sweet. Sweet like the pox of the owls.

(Say what? Didn't know owl pox was sweet. I believe this is alluding to the deaths of Sophie's parents at Olaru Farm.)

> If I can not have it, why else have it?

(Another winner.)

> The cop knows I was. He plays with me as a black bird clings to the poor lamb. He will not die in the sleep, like the others.
> 
> The mournfulness of darkness, the joy of beloved and dead brothers. He tells me to bring the cop. Bring it where my hate started.

And I believe all that means go back to the bridge over Lover's Creek, "where my hate started." (943, 801), in the river slumped against the bridge support.

The "message written within us all" is probably DNA, so search for `dna 45477804 45481340` and you get [this technical page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/phegeni?chr=1&from=45477804&to=45481340&fromto=45477804+45481340&tab=0#pgGTEX). Looking under the eQTL section, the only gene that appears is [UROD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7389) which is another technical page (it's the NIH, it's supposed to be). The summary says that mutations in this gene are known to cause "familial porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoetic porphyria". So… [`porphyria`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria).

      FLEVIT                    ARBOR
          ILLE

Interestingly, google gives different translations depending on the case:

`ille flevit dixit 'infernus sicut superius'` is `He wept said, 'Hell, just above'`, while `ille flevit dixit 'Infernus sicut superius'` is `He wept, said, "With the above '` (including the weird non-matching quotes and trailing space.) All uppercase `ILLE FLEVIT DIXIT 'INFERNUS SICUT SUPERIUS'` becomes `HE wept said a "hell as described above '` so I think some work may need to be done on the Latin translator, although which version of latin to use is a question (classical latin has no letter case, but medieval latin does.)

I think the message may be intended to be `Under the oldest tree he wept, saying, "As above, so below."` or something similar.

In any case, go around to the back of the big tree in the park (you'll see a message saying the leaves whisper when you're in the right spot) and `/cry`. And as you cry below, so the tree cries above. With leaves. Then glowing. Follow follow.

Two coins for the ferryman, and I guess we're stabbing people in the mouth now. To be fair, he wasn't a nice man.

    Venus and Mercury in their courses; in the lowest sphere the Moon revolves, lit by the rays of the sun.

There is a map of the earth on the door at the far end of the room, so we'll call that Earth, the fourth brazier back from that is larger than the others, so we'll call that the Sun. That leaves three braziers in between the Earth and the Sun, which fits the clue (Venus, Mercury, and the Moon.)

Venus, Mercury, the Moon, and the Sun. Light 'em up. `Venus and Mercury in their courses`, so [Mercury first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System), then Venus, `in the lowest sphere the Moon revolves` so it's next, `lighted by the rays of the sun` making it last. At least I think that's the logic. Marking the brazier closest the map door as `1`, the order is `3-2-1-4`.

# Obstructive Persons

The note that drops off the Morninglight goon has a partially hidden web address: [http://www.joinmornin...](http://www.joinmorninglight.com/). You can guess the rest. Go ahead, sign up.

    [Oops... the system was unable to finish your operation (error code 0x0000019Cx3)]

The error code is interesting. And a hexadecimal number, if you ignore the `x3`.

```php
echo hexdec('19c');
```

Hex `19c` is decimal `412`. Now stop ignoring the `x3`.

Find a Morninglight laptop. There's one in London at the Morninglight booth beside the park; not sure of any others. Answer the questions using the decimal value of the error. Three times.

-----

(Let's pontificate slightly on the possibilities for this confluence. One of three things has happened.

1. The error code given when signing up is a reminder to the more dense of Morninglight operatives as to how to get into the secret menu.
2. The error code given when signing up is changed at a set interval, so Morninglight operatives need to get the error code to view the secret menu.
3. Pure coincidence. The error code given when trying to give Morninglight your contact info just happens to be the code used to get into their secret menu.

2 seems the most likely, at least from an operational security/spycraft standpoint, although based on interactions with their agents I wouldn't discount 1. 3 is just way out there, statistically. The chances of an essentially random error message giving the correct sequence of menu items to select is less than vanishingly small, especially with that `x3` tacked onto the end.

However if it is 2, that means that either the Morninglight people would need to enter a specific name and/or email to get the error to pop up (unlikely, since I tried with Bob Loblaw, a 112-year old with the email bloblaw@example.com as well as Alina Florea, 22, alina90@gmail.com),  or the signup form always fails which, for an organization that seems to want to recruit as many layabouts as possible, seems unlikely. It is possible that they harvest the contact info and return the error anyway, but lets not give them too much credit.

All of this is a roundabout way of pointing a finger and shouting, "CONTRIVED!" But I suppose I'm still having fun, so whatever.

As a final aside, Funcom may want to set `display_errors` to `false` in their php.ini, or (if it already has been) remove the `ini_set('display_error', true)` directive in joinmorninglight.com/sent.php. Or check `isset($email)` and `isset($req-email)` on lines 62 and 68 respectively. But really, don't display errors on a production server.)

-----

Close `Alina Florea`'s file, and pick up the next: Dusko Biukovic. Last seen in London, although he's no longer there. Used to live in Romania, so off to Transylvania to look for an anxious man of medium height with short brown hair and glasses. He's standing in front of the house to the west of the Owl and the Eagle (the inn) in the Beseiged Farmlands.

## Tier 4/4

`The master's son.` Well "the master" is probably Philip Marquard, the leader of the Morninglight. His son's name is Alexandre, which you can find out from part 8 of the Global > Groups > Morninglight lore section (this is the one from the top of the vehicle in the tunnel beside Alina, who started this whole thing, so you should have picked it up.)

Enter the password `alexandre` and the quest ends. You can read the files, which include information on Rada Nastase (quest hub in Carpathian Fangs), Cassandra King (she stole Excalibur in Kingsmouth), Naonomi Tanaka (in Kaidan, don't recall her story), John Copley (I believe the South African making deals with the Atenists in Egypt), and you (the player). Wouldn't say my *greatest* fear is anarchy, but I do miss the taco achievement.

      2

When facing east, `4` is at the top of the circle.

    1 2 3 4 1 4 3 2 1 2 3

**Second song:** (1022, 767)

Same setup, facing east, `4` is at the top.

    4 4 3 1 4 2 1 4 3 2 2 4 2 1

**Third song:** (1052, 526)

Same again, facing east, no light beam hints? You sons of mothers…

Ok, It's not actually that bad. There are still only four tones, and it starts by going from highest to lowest, so just write down the notes as numbers and translate after.

    1 2 3 4 -> tonal position
    4 3 2 1 -> actual position

The tones are played in this order: `43213142313214`, so the resulting stone activation is:

    1 2 3 4 2 4 1 3 2 4 2 3 4 1 

**I do hate mushrooms:** (895, 428)

1. Iele's Melody
2. Melody of the Deep Glade
3. Melody of the Shallow Waters
4. Melody of the Fallen

This annoyed me. A lot. The fourth note played is obviously the same as the first (they're both E's), so I logically assumed it was *Fallen* again, not *Iele*. Of course that doesn't work. The second note in *Iele* is also an E, but come on…

So the order is:

    4 1 3 1 2 1

But I still think they should change that fourth note.

# Mortal Sins

## Tier 10/29

> Apă Vie, the light of the morning;

Well it's obviously going to be in Romanian: life = `viaţă`

I kept thinking "path of life" (calea vieții) and "water of life" (apa vieții). Fail fail fail.

## Tier 11/29

> Apă Moartă, the final forwarning.

It's called the Waters of Death. Did you think you'd get there while living? Besides, it's in the lair; better to start off dead. Follow the river, follow the ghosts.

Oh lore, thou temptress… (912, 357)

# Trials of the Dragon

## Tier 2/5

There's a warrior just the the northwest of the Romany camp, (780, 926). You don't get a block, dodging doesn't work, and you can't cancel attacks. Don't hit him when he's blocking, or you'll lose most of your health and likely lose (unblockable, undodgable knock-down punches.) Wait for his block to end, then use a large punch. That'll knock him down, and you can cleanup from there. And don't forget to re-equip your weapons.

## Tier 3/5

Behind the Abandoned Taverna in Hell's Row is the portal to the Trial of Fire.

## Tier 4/5

You're trying to get to (1078,391). It's easiest to head around west, watch out for the patrolling shadow and fungal giant. If you get caught, you'll have to leave the lair and try again.

## Tier 5/5

There is Romanian graphiti to the left side of the arch after passing the green gate.

    Boltă peste Măcelar.
    
    Over the Butcher.

Kill the butcher (309, 844), jump up on the left overhang (facing him), travel along the stones to the right side. Next graphiti:

    Cu lumina celor drepți
    
    With the light of the righteous

Kill the Deacon (205, 787). Next clue is on the inside left door behind him:

    De stai în astă ușă, opt și treizeci îți va fi călăuza.
    
    Standing in this door, eight and thirty will be your guide.

8:30? 38? To be honest, I'm not sure what they're going for with this. Possibly 38° from the door when horizontal is 0 and positive is clockwise (that looks more like 40°)? Maybe 8:30 on the clock when facing west? It's not a great clue. But the next step is up half-way along the wall at (255, 731), on the corner of a building. Hard to see.

    Uită-te în gura dragonului
    
    Look in the mouth of the dragon

The dragon is just north of the last graphiti, wrapped around the legs of the statue of Vlad.

    Doar dacă pleci pe unde ai venit, a îngerilor viziune ai zărit.
    
    Only if you leave where you came, the visions of the angels you have seen.

Exit the city and read the graphiti between the angel statues on the bridge.

    Pe pod până ce Luna se culcă, apoi o cauți unde se aruncă.
    
    On the bridge until the moon is down, then you look for her where she is thrown.

Um. Sometimes I think having to run what are possibly cryptic clues through a machine translator may not be the best approach to building puzzles.

Head to the only open door in the northwest corner of the city and look for the "odd bump" in the wood between the dressers. There's also a carving of a dragon in the table. Possibly intended to be a pointer. (No, that's a thing for a story mission.)

Head outside, look left, and see the wall open up. Grab the artifact and you're done.

# The Abandoned

## Tier 1/5

It's greek around the edge of the coin.

    Τοúτω μεν, óν κóαμος ουκ εχωρει, νυν τύμβος αρκεí
    Then, when a man does not go, there is still a tumulus.
    
It's not a lot to go on. A tumulus is an ancient burial mound. There is a graveyard around here. At (760, 565) is a crypt, the entrance of which is flanked by two statues of knights. The helmet of the knight on the right side is clickable. The helmet of the left knight is missing, along with its head.

## Tier 2/5

    ΤΡΕ´ΙΣ ΑΔΕΡΦ´ΕΣ ΓΕΝΝ´ΗΘΗΚΑΝ,
    ΑΠ' ΤΟ Α´ΙΜΑ ΤΟΥ ΜΕΓ´ΑΛΟΥ,
    ´ΟΠΟΥ ΣΥΝΘ´ΗΚΗ ΟΠ´ΙΣΤΗΚΕ,
    ΓΙΑ ΝΑ ΠΡΟΣΤΑΤΕΥΘΟ´Υ ΑΠ´Ο ΤΗ ΜΟ´ΙΡΑ,

    Three were born
    from the mother of the Great,
    which treaty establishes
    to protect from fate
    Athens and the wild
    from the effects of time.
    Their true names have been kept secret
    the god of Desmo.

Not entirely sure what that last line is. "Desmo" is just a transliteration of the greek letters, so may not actually be a name. Of course it doesn't matter that much, since we're really just interested in the book on the table at the end of the room. But the daughter you're looking for is the Iele.

An aside: you need to attack the ropes (very Alexander, slice the knot!) They don't really highlight, so it's a bit of a nuisance if you don't remember.

I didn't remember.

## Tier 3/5

    Mama ia copilul în brațe, cu o bucățică de mămăfigă iese în ogradă, 
    rupe mămăliga în trei și descântă de trei ori, aruncând spre pădure 
    de fiecare dată câte o bucată:
    
    Mama Pădurii,
    Am trimis un semn la tine,
    De la copilul meu,
    Să-ți dau strânsul cu plânsul,
    Si să-mi dai somnul și odihna fetii tale
    Ca să doarmă ca butucul
    Si să tacă ca chiticul.
    Cum dorm păsările în pădure,
    Așa să doarmă copilul la mine.
    
    
    The mother takes the baby in her arms, with a piece of moss, comes 
    out into the garden, breaks the mallow in three, and sinks three times, 
    throwing a piece of wood every time:
    
    Mother of the Forest,
    I send a sign to you,
    From my child,
    Let me grieve you with the weeping,
    And give me the sleep and the rest of your faces,
    To sleep like a hub
    And keep quiet like the chit.
    How birds sleep in the woods,
    So sleep the baby at me.
    
There is a Romany Man standing at the south end of Siren's Lake (south of Anastasia's Wagon). As you approach, a Mysterious Woman appears and the man follows her. Off you go.

A Kali-Ma later and you can pick up the next clue from the Romany Man's corpse. Also, lore.

This can sometimes bug out. It took four tries following the Mysterious Woman before the quest advanced. I don't recall seeing the timer to follow her the first three times, and those three failed times also successfully hit me with the Forest's Malaise debuff, while the last try (which progressed the quest to the next tier) did not. 🤷

## Tier 4/5

    Du cojile de ou la izvorul râului, în dealurile 
    de la soare-apune. Nu a venit vremea Paștelui 
    Blajinilor, însă cei mici n-au mai apărut de 
    prea mult timp. Aruncă cojile în apă - dacă 
    soarta ne e prielnică, Blajinii le vor găsi și ne 
    vor da norocul lor.

Translation:
    
    Take the egg shells to the river's spring in the hills of the sun-set.
    The time of the Blajin Passover has not come, but the little ones have
    not appeared for too long. Throw the peels in the water - if our fate is
    good, the Blajinii will find them and they will give us their luck.

"Hills of sun-set", hills where the sun sets, hills in the western part of the map. The river starts at (314, 549), and grab the faun lore.

After following the eggshells you end up at about (405, 676) where a Blajini comes out of a grey portal and takes them. Now we have to follow him.

Into death!

Tediousness…

I *think* you can just wander as fast as you can over to around (474, 932) and skip the complete waste of time following the blajini.

Talk to one of the Spectral Blajini to receive a painted egg. You need to be alive to inspect it. Back to Mosul.

## Tier 5/5

Target a player and click on one of the Children's Book, Book of the Iele, or Reassembled Egg. This completes the mission, and the player you have selected will get one of three lore pieces. You won't get it, they will. How forcedly altruistic. What makes it worse is that the lore appears right in front of you while you're telling the story, but of course you can't get it, you're busy talking. This is one of the worst quest endings I've encountered in any game.

# The Cellar Door

## Tier 3/4

The door codes are in binary. Every door except 2, 6, and 7 release two Imprisoned Ghouls (which of course causes the achievement to fail.)

* `010` - 2: lore and a dead blajini with a note
* `110` - 6: imprisoned faun, which progresses the quest
* `111` - 7: the doors to the east block

To continue the mission, open door `110`, look in cell 6, then door `111`.

Strangely, if you close a door with monsters and then open it again, the monsters reappear. I'd have to say it's a slow way to farm, two at a time…

# The Red Thread

## Tier 1/5

From a book found in the back left corner of the library in the Monastery of Our Lady:

> Inside *Metamorphosen Liber Secundus*
>
> We always did dance around each other. Of course I knew you were in love with me, you vile dilettante. Why else would you have stayed in the castle when he went away. Why else would you be seeking my secrets even now? I'm sure the centuries have done nothing to sharpen your verse, but what about your wit?
>
> My past has been hidden in the long shadows of gods,
> My soul is a song you must play in the dark,
> These, the weights of my burdens,
> Mara, 1863.

## Tier 2/5

> My past has been hidden in the long shadows of gods,

Light casts shadows, and candles cast light. Blow out all the candles. It takes a bit but it's not too hard.

## Tier 3/5

> My soul is a song you must play in the dark,

Musical Interlude.

Symbols of 

  1. Calisto
  2. Diana
  3. Jupiter
  4. Juno

Each symbol plays a note, and you need to play a song to remove the ward. Luckily, you've been following a song played with only four notes.

    1 2 3 3 4 3 2 3 2 1 2 3 4 3 3 2 2 1

## Tier 4/5

> These, the weights of my burdens,

Calisto was a follower of Diana right up until she was turned into a bear by Juno because Jupiter (Juno's husband) seduced Calisto while he was disguised as Diana. While the references may make sense, the story will not because [Ils sont fous ces romains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelix).

From left to right:

* Jupiter (Vlad)
* Calisto (Allesandro)
* Juno (the "Other" woman, probably Lilith)
* Diana (Mara)


## Tier 5/5

> The water babbles, Calisto, but not for you. Because you were never among her favoured.

We're in the frozen north, so there's no babbling brooks outside. Instead head toward the Roman Baths. Work your way through them until you come to the pool of water (beside the boss monster General Blasius.) Now we need to pick the lock.

Back to the mythology: In order to save Calisto from being killed by her son (who was out hunting bears) Jupiter turned both Calisto and her son into the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. And we just happen to be presented with a pool of stars.

[This page](http://www.solarsystemquick.com/universe/ursa-major-constellation.htm) has a decent diagram of stars and their relative "sizes" in the constellation of Ursa Major. It's probably easiest to find the big dipper and work out from there. Face south in the pool and find the three large stars that match Alkaid, Mizar-Alcor, and Alioth; those make up the handle of the big dipper (or the tail of the bear, although that never made much sense to me; I haven't seen many bears with tails that long.)

# Love and Origami

I just straight up cheated on this one. It's actually pretty interesting, and if there were a way of easily printing or exporting the pages in order to fold it properly, I'd be all for it. But there isn't, apart from screenshots and irritatingly aligning pages in photoshop. Who has time for this? (I say that with the full knowledge that I am playing a game when I could be doing other more "worthwhile" tasks, but do-not-cross lines make appearances everywhere.) Also, why can't I draw characters in google translate on mobile devices? I have a stylus, it works spectacularly, and barring that moving a finger around on a screen is still easier than drawing with a mouse, but for some reason google has decided that tablet users wouldn't benefit from the multitude of keyboards and input methods made available to desktops.

Anyway…

1. **(472, 903)** - "I will wait for you on a bench by the northern shore."
2. **(947 734)** - "I will wait for you beneath the Cherry Blossom Tree in Ginpachi Park."
3. **(452, 814)** - "I will go to the Pachinko Parlour. Meet me there."
4. **(178, 793)** - "Innocence broken, fading like the morning light, bathe away my pain."

# Fierce Competition

## Tier 2/5

The main plaza is the sculpture of the city just east of Susanoo's Diner.

> Align the gap to the rising sun, on the bottom - that's the passcode!

If you head back to the plaza with the statue and take a look to the east ("the rising sun") through the gap in the buildings, you can see the billboards. The bottom billboard has the words "Spark the Light". This is the password for the laptop.

## Tier 3/5

You have 60 seconds to solve the puzzle.

If you look closely, you can see there are slightly raised squares on the base of the sculpture. Cover the squares. And don't forget the big one in the top left, and the building in the cluster on the right side just below the top right corner.

The body is along the wall at around (525, 417).

## Tier 4/5

Follow red until you reach the corpse. Then the blue until you reach the Dream Palace.

## Tier 5/5

You're looking for a laptop. It's basically invisible. Facing the Dream Palace, it's behind the first pillar on the left.

> Count ninety-nine seconds and pluck two words out of my heart shaped box.

Well, there *was* a picture of a music player. Nirvana, Heart-Shaped Box. 99 seconds in: `angel hair`.

# Choose Your Own

## Tier 1/6

First up is to find a computer old enough to have a floppy drive. There is one in the computer cafe in Seoul, but the bathhouse in Kaidan is closer, and is also using ancient hardware.

Next disk is in Kingsmouth (580, 365). The computer is in the police station. (You'll need to use the floppy disk reader, not the computer.)

## Tier 3/6

**The Failed Audition**

* exit

  * The Pallid Mask is a reference to the fictional play *The King in Yellow*, and appears in a book of short stories by Robert W. Chambers (also titled *[The King in Yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_in_Yellow)*) The first stanza of the play indicates that the characters are in a city called "Carcosa".
* read book

* attack
  * this is a leap. Seems like the only way to get here (apart from looking it up) would be out of frustration
* Tim
* get crowbar
* get book
  * Here is another example of the fragility of this text adventure engine: if you pick up the book before the crowbar, your inventory will show "Book, Crowbar". If you proceed south and attempt to use the crowbar on the door, you will get the message "You cannot do that right now". The only way this puzzle works is if you pick up the crowbar first, then the book, which gives you the inventory "Crowbar, Book". I'm tempted to say they're looking for `inventory.substr(0, 7) == 'Crowbar'` which would be insane. I'm still a little confused why they didn't try to incorprate something like the [Inform engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inform), which is a far more robust solution for implementing these puzzles.
* s

  * This threw me for a bit, until I looked back at the notes. *The King in Yellow*. Duh.
* down
* Hastur
  * "If you want to invoke a king, you have but to speak his name. The place and the god." From *The Repairer of Reputations* (and the wikipedia page) Hastur is connected by lakes and is also a god of shepherds.

*The Failed Audition* took place in London, so off we go to the Albion Theatre. Talk to the Booking Manager (to the right, just inside the door) and head backstage. Pick up the Theatre Control System from beside the computer.

* Backdrops -> Pattern -> Yellow Gradient -> Back
* Lighting -> Spotlight Toggle: Center -> Back
* Curtain

The character in *The Failed Audition* went to center stage and bowed. So should you.

After leaving the theatre, turn right and start walking. At the end of the street is a yellow sign of The Yellow Sign. It's a bit on the nose. The next disk is under the Bingo Cola vending machine.

Unfortunately you'll need to pay to get backstage to that CRT again, so it's probably best to just find another computer. The machines previously used are still around.

## Tier 4/6

**Witch Feast**

* get Zhivaya Voda
* use cauldron

The game actually had "beseiged farmlands" in it, so…

While I generally wouldn't associate Cucuvea with Baba Yaga, why not. Plus, she has a computer.

"Place the name of the Hag in the glowing cauldron." So the hag's name is Baba Yaga, but that's not what the children in *Witch Feast* wrote. `Iron Tooth`

"The town where the dead never lie." You could say they always tell the truth. Iăzmaciune!

"The door lit by a torch on its right." The chapel in the center behind Misha, the Butcher is not correct. Even though it fits the clue. Instead go to the southeast corner of the city (381, 774).


## Tier 5/6

It's at this point that I'm pretty sure the Swarm is a bunch of jerks.

**One Way Out**

Well. First, don't forget to pick up the completed game disk. I was running around for ages trying to figure out what happened. Head out the room, down the stairs and enter the doorway that's opened to your right. The take a left. Then die.

More or less.

# The Meowling

## Tier 3/6

A group of thirteen cats on Soloman Island. First guess it at the graveyard behind the church. But no, that's something else. This is a cross-map experience: head to Blue Mountain and visit Mrs. Franklin.

## Tier 4/6

Too much running around… It's in the attic.

> May the seven sisters keep her safe, now and in the year of her death.

The seven sisters is almost always the Pleiades, and there just happens to be a a painting of Elihu Vedder's *The Pleiades* in the gallery upstairs. It may be reversed, though…

Also, "the year of her death" is the year of Elena Zhelikovsky's death (Madame Rogêt mentioned her, and she's in that book about the things. Also in the Franklin Mansion lore.) 1957


## Tier 5/6

Annapurna is a shop in London. The owner seems to like olives. Davi-ees!

> Freshly picked seeds chewed to destroy fair Boadicea,

Fennel, from Egypt. The pharoah had a garden; it's corrupt, now. Also: where is this "The Backyard"? Below a railway?

Well that's disappointing. The garden is apparently so corrupt now that there aren't any fennel plants left. So much for choice… Back to London, then. "The Backyard" is Ealdwick Park. Check the northwest corner.

> mixed in equal parts to calming leaves from the Capon's Tail,

Valerian. Transylvania, in the lake beside the gypsy's wagon. Or look behind the register in Annapurna.

I didn't check, but based on what happened with the Pharoah's Fennel, I wouldn't be surprised to find out they've removed the valerian plants from the Shadowy Forest. That's actually very disappointing. If I want to take the time to travel around the world collecting these ingredients, let me. It's what I did for the previous three years, and I didn't really have an issue with it.

> and one part the maiden's watcher of the road.

[Chicory](http://capitalnaturalist.blogspot.ca/2014/06/chicory-watcher-of-road.html). Sold at the House of Chalk, just across the street from Annapurna.

## Tier 6/6

As the notes in the SWL launcher state (October 2017), if you try to combine the ingredients before reaching the ritual site, you will place the quest in an unfinishable state, requiring assistance from a GM to progress. So don't.

As the book in the Tier 5 image says, "Sobhoban Stone? Vinterskog? Wispwood?". You can try going to the Wispwood in Kingsmouth, but you'll be wrong. The Savage Coast, just east of the Vinterskog Woods anima leap point.

-----

# The Cat God

Well that's a nice surprise. No need to find a group, just head on into the portal and beat up some cats.

-----

#Spiral

For the achievement:

Jump onto rubble, make sure you're not sprinting, couch, palette, down the plank, onto the what is that, a deep fryer? then down the next plank and jump onto the mattress. Over to the palette, across the board to the next palette, jump to the filing cabinet, pick up the side quest Population of Filth, jump to the fridge to the right, turn slightly and pull the fuse. No more electricity. First floor complete.

Up the first flight of stairs to the landing. Note the tripwire at the base of the next flight; jump over it. Down the hallway, killing filthy humans in the first room, stop at the body in the hall (second door). Walk. There will likely be more filthy humans, keep walking, don't use active dodge. Also, don't fight beside the hole in the floor. You'll likely end up on the rakes. After fighting, don't step on the rakes. Up the first flight of stairs, landing, flight two, second floor!

Look down the hallway toward the potato guns. Left, right, left, right, both, slight pause, repeat. You should sprint here, across the gap, down the hallway. Can't go up, head down, more filth. One room open, one filth and a Black Signal lore inside. Backtrack… Back at where you were watching the potato guns, watch again, then run toward them (at the appropriate time) and in through the open door. More filth (should be at 21 now) through the hole in the wall and don't touch the door before you pull the fuse. Now open the door, but don't step through, the potato guns are just to your right. Time it right again and run between them; that way you'll miss the rake around the corner. Kill the filth on the landing above, and if you don't have it head down the stairs to the lore, The Black Signal #9. Back up the stairs to the landing, another trip wire (two paints cans this time). Jump over it and up to floor 3.

These trip wires… possibly you can shoot them out. Elevation thing?

Left is blocked, so jump over yet another trip wire and head up the stairs to the fourth floor. After killing the filth (should be finished the side quest now) down the hallway you can take the stairs (WALK! marbles on the landing, and jump the trip wire at the bottom) back down to the third floor. Filth to the right, traverse the bridge to the left. Filth through the first open door, nothing else. Glue and a filthy corner. It's the tentacular one, keeps pulling you in. Annoying, but shouldn't be too difficult to dispatch. Down the stairs on the landing is the final "The Black Signal" lore. Back up and jump over the trip wire heading up to floor four. (Careful on this one. Because of the glue you have to get pretty close. Possibly you can just walk across the sack intersecting it, but I don't really trust the engine that much.)

Attack the broom, call the elevator, up to the fifth floor and done!

-----

# All Alone Together

## Tier 1/5

Sure, easy. When you cheat. Down an alley at (740, 750) there is a dumpster. He's inside it. Also, Kaidan lore 10.

flashygurl27 is up past the graveyard at the flower cart guarded by the Corrupted Flower Seller (856, 660) who no longer attacks on sight, so there's that. Examine the camera.

Amaya worked for Orochi, so you can search for her name in the [Orochi Employee Finder](http://orochi-group.com/?action=efinder) and find out she was last seen in Ginpachi Park. And as it happens, she left her uniform there, by the tree (facing the entrance to Agartha, head clockwise about a quarter circle.)

Phattrax has a website with pictures of his car. The car is in a parking lot at (245, 880). So is Phattrax.

-----

# Youth Outreach

## Tier 2/5

Search for clues. There is a sign just south of the kindergarten with the phrase "we can find the swan within every ugly duckling". This leads down to the dock of the shinto shrine island in the south of Kaidan (761, 59) where you'll see swan boats.

Into the water, on the underside of the dock is another message: "Don't fear the dead Fear nothing!" with the date 13/9/1965. Inspect the graphiti to continue (this takes some effort to get the position correct.)

## Tier 3/5

"Don't fear the dead." Graveyard. (755, 179) Search for clues among the Illimitable Kyonshi, and don't miss the two lore pieces. 

Find the plaque, read the words.

               Paul Art
          September 13, 1965
    
    The words of the prophets are
     written on the subway walls

## Tier 4/5

To the subway (964, 334). Enter the southerly subway tunnel and inspect the graphiti on the north wall.

> The door is the future

> The sun is the key

> Don't get your feet wet

> - The Prophet

## Tier 5/5

(681, 271)

"The sun is the key". The graphiti in each tier has a sun, of which a single "ray" is highlighted. Three pieces of graphiti, three suns, four bricks. Through elimination, three of four works.

      1  2
    4      3

(You'll also need this combination to enter the Clubhouse when replaying My Bloody Valentine and One Kill Ahead.)

# Climbing Faust

There is a computer on floor 19 of Faust Capital that allows you to enter a safe deposit box number and security code. Beside the door opposite the terminal is a paper sticking out of a folder on the floor with the numbers `58219`. This is the security code. In the center room are six open safe deposit boxes, each with a three-digit id. The security code is only valid with one box number: `247`, on the north wall the one with the corpse beside it. (At least it was in my run; it's possible the box/code are randomized each time.) Entering the box id and code in the computer gives this:

    Box ID: 247
    Owner: D. Ghould
    Contents: Relics acquired during a recent 
    Egyptian cleanup operation. Do not open without 
    Director approval.

This has no bearing on completion of the quest.

## Tier 3/3

On floor 19 you can choose between knowledge and musical talent.

**Musical Talent**

Play the flute. Different colors for different notes. The keys are thus:

    1 4 4 4 4 5 3 2 2 2
    1 2 2 2 2 4 5 4 4 4
    1 5 5 5 5 4 2 6 4 3
    3 1 1 1 1 3 2 6 4 4

Either the achievement is broken, or it's very lenient. I made a lot of mistakes getting the notes, and then on the final step (play all four lines at once) I had five 2's on line two. Got it on the second attempt and was awarded the achievement.

In TSW you got a flute. No flute in SWL. I am sad.

**Knowledge**

Answer three riddles.

    You heard me before, yet you hear me again. Then I die 'til you call me again. What am I?

Answer: Echo

    A rich man needs me,
    a poor man has me,
    and if you eat me you die.
    What am I?

Answer: Nothing

    We've talked. You've seen my game. Can you guess my name?

Answer: Mephistopheles

Answer those three and get the lore for The Jinn and the First Age.

-----

# Climbing Anasi

## Tier 3/3

Nutso AI. It's a theme we just can't seem to shake.

Did these riddles change? I don't recall.

    I never was, am always to be;
    No one ever saw me, nor ever will,
    And yet I am the confidence of all
    To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball.

# Achievement: The Perfect Cover

### Foundling
While wearing the Foundling Morninglight Jumpsuit (the brown/yellow one), sit on one of the benches under the pavilion in the southwest corner of the foundling area (with the preacher, ~(438, 610).) Listen to the entirety of the preacher's sermon ("A stranger comes in from the darkness…"). If you're sitting on the bench for the whole sound file, the achievement will pop.

### Annointed
While wearing the Annointed Morninglight Jumpsuit (the red one), `/worship` with the rest of the crazies at the statue of Marquard in the Annointed Quarters (around (533, 445)). After a complete cycle of the emote, you will get the achievement step.

### Favoured
This one is not at all easy to figure out, and in truth makes little sense. During Tier 2 of the mission "One Flew Over" (given by Che Hansson), you will enter the warehouse with the piles of rotting human remains. After taking care of the workers on the warehouse floor, look under the left staircase heading up above the cage. There will be a usable hazmat suit on the ground (it does not light up). Use this, and then wander back toward the warehouse entrance, climb the piles of bones to the left of the doors (making sure to pick up entry 2 of the Aigamuxa lore) and jump onto the top of the entrance. Up here there is an "Abnormally large skull"; examine it, and you will receive the Favoured step of the achievement.

How this improves your cover identity…well it doesn't, since everyone who would have seen you has been killed by you or, in the case of Brother Tooth, is about to be killed by you and eww there _are_ eyes on his feet.

## Dave's PC

For the impatient: `1`, `6`, `The Lonely Patriot`. But go ahead and read the rest.

## The Presenter

If you're trying this on the highest difficulty you can, you may want to take out the radios in front of the Presenter before attacking him at all. That will prevent all the adds from spawning. Of course if you're going for the achievements, stack hitpoints and self-healing, or try it on a lower difficulty.

# The Kingsmouth Code

## Tier 1

Follow the direction the pyramids on the manhole covers point.

## Tier 2

At the town hall, inspect the portrait of Frans Hals(?).

## Tier 3

The note on the painting says the "hands of time point to truths written by kings", and the clock on the wall is stuck at 10:10. Truths written by kings would be the Book of Kings in the Old Testament. So 1 Kings 10:10.

> And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

Solomon Priest has a house in Kingsmouth (had?), and there's a locked basement around the back. The code to open the door is in the verse: "an hundred and twenty talents".

## Tier 4

The password to the computer is in the hint, you just need the latin translation. Helpfully, it's written on all the manhole covers around town.

# Crime and Punishment

## Tier 1

The stupidest sentimental name is apparently "Lover's Regret". Follow that to Krieg's car and pick up the gps.

## Tier 2

    Your journey has been calculated. Please exit onto a mapped road.
    Continue eastbound for 200 yards, and take the second exit.
    Prepare to turn right.
    Turn right, and follow the road for 500 yards.
    Continue to follow the road.
    Prepare to turn left.
    Turn left now.
    Navigation is paused.

We'll need to follow the directions backwards, and face bacwards while doing it. I mean not really, but left becomes right and vice versa. We can throw away the "turn left now", since that's what Krieg was doing when he ran into the fence.

A left turn from Henderson's Gate onto Lover's Regret would take you toward the lighthouse, so "continue to follow the road" until we get to an intersection where you could make a right turn onto Henderson's. Ignore the amusement park, he wasn't coming from there. We end up at Solomon Road. Head west for 200 yards (180 meters.)

This gets us somewhere in the vicinity of the gas station.

Based on Krieg's letter to Lucinda, he threw a picture away. So check the garbage cans.

-----

For fun:

(532, 685) - Intersection of Solomon and Henderson's

(362, 746) - Sycoil gas station northeast corner

    362 - 532 = -170
    746 - 685 = 61
    
       |
    61 |
       |__________
           170

    c^2 = a^2 + b^2
    c^2 = 61^2 + 170^2
      c = √32621
        = 180.6

Huh. Trigonometry works.

## Tier 3

Match the front of the house in the picture with the front of the houses on Solomon Road.

## Tier 4

samkriegsightings.wordpress.com is… Well, it is.

Way down at April 2:

Under [List of Works](https://samkriegsightings.wordpress.com/list-of-works) we can find books, years, and ISBNs. Trial and error.

## Tier 5

Hardcover original of [*Foucault's Pendulum*](https://www.amazon.com/Foucaults-Pendulum-Umberto-Eco/dp/0151327653/). I wonder how long that link will work?

Another ISBN. This time we want the entire 13 digits: `9780151327652`.

(I went looking on the wikipedia page for the book which does have ISBNs for the original and english translations, but they're not the same ones. Even after going through the [ISBN Converter](http://isbn.org/ISBN_converter) to get the correct format, it was a different edition. So I guess the amazon search is the correct one? But again: how long will that work?)

# Foundations

## Tier 2/3

The tablet is at (349, 842). The more modern tablet is behind the bush.

    Orochi Field Terminal Online
    
    Field Log 0864
    
    Another tablet, another partial translation. I'm
    more interested in where they got this thing.
    
    "Mistress of Dread! Lady of Slaughter!
    Where blood had run down temple stairs,
    And carried away upon water, the builder stood.
    He looked to the horizon to find her perch."

"Lady of Slaughter" sounds like Hemitneter. The First Temple is to the east of her, and it has stairs. And there's a dead Orochi agent just to the left of the western stairs (165, 345).

    Orochi Field Terminal Online
    
    Field Log 0865
    
    This tablet has been sandblasted, there's not a
    lot to go on. Translation:
    
    "...builder gazed out on the divine lake,
    And said, she would not face the tomb,
    For in doing so it would give him power.

    "Me--tse--r"?)

Meretseger, perhaps. For Moutemouia. And she's not looking at the black pyramid. Jump down the cliff north of her and there's another dead Orochi agent, (805, 293).

    If this is the final section, this hunt has been
    a bust. What bridge, what two worlds? Heading
    back to base camp when this storm has died down.
    
    "In his life, he saw four of seven raised.
    On his deathbed, the three planned.
    In death, two worlds bridged.
    A temple between the above and below.
    It gives praise to his shining works,
    And to the golden field of his rest."

The four are apparently the still standing pillars on the way to the entrance to Agartha, although that doesn't really fit. When this tablet was written, possibly there were only four built by the time "he" died, but there are eight pillars, and no one would have guessed which pillars would still be standing now. So I don't buy that logic.

However, kill yourself: "in death, two worlds bridged." The Great Architect is on the right heading toward the Agarthan portal, although quite difficult to see what with the monochromatic color scheme (757, 142). Speak to him, follow him.

To his skeleton, apparently. This makes even less sense. Did he sit down here and die? When did that happen? Did no one notice? Is he not the builder mentioned in the tablets? The ones that say "on his deathbed the three planned"? You'd think someone would have noticed.

Anyway, that's the end, it's never mentioned again. So I guess it doesn't matter.

# Fog and Mirrors

Two ciphers. Messages prefaced by `C1` use the first, `C2` use the second.

Site Alpha: 1472 Pearl St. That's right, in New York. Meet there after extraction. The front door is locked. Passcode is lat and long of the Forbidden City. You know the one. In Italy.

1472 Pearl St - New York (294, 420)

But… the Forbidden City is in China.

Venice, Italy (45, 12)

PC Password is IRONPUP33596

Rest of the cipher key is in the password hint?

    0123456789
    2345678901

So it's not `33596`, it's `11374`? `IRONPUP11374`


Bay 1 security code - 8452

Bay 2 - something weird in the big box? T. Harolds keeps getting headaches near it.

Bay 3 - weird smelling puddle?

Cipher C2R - take the rightmost letter of the bottom half of the key (C2), put it on the left side and shift the bottom right by 1.

*Insanity.*

> I changed the code on the 2nd gate. It is 112770

The girlfriend's birthday is 12/27/92

# When the Hatchet Falls

## Tiers 5-7

1. Turn on the lights
  - flip the switch on the left
  - spin the wheel on the right
  - pressure - vetical lever increases, wheel decreases
  - at 70% hit the button (red light on the left is 0, 14 up from that)
    - it's the second-last green light, although the contrast between green and yellow is so small it's almost useless
2. destroy the shield generator in the room up the stairs
3. open the maglock door with the key from the room with the generator
4. the code for the door can be found in the barracks (jump over the lasers to get there)
  - 1878
5. next maglock door (past the cameras; you can ignore the room with the creepy dolls unless you want the lore)
6. room tot he left contains two more magkeys, room to the right: more lore
7. Use the keys to open and unlock the left door, use the EMP Pulser to lock the left door open, retrieve the keys, open and unlock the right door.
8. Disable the security protocols (the password is `password`)

# A Match Made in Rosenbrawl

## Tier 1/4

So… Use the Soulmate, wait what could possibly be an interminable amount of time for the game to match you up with someone (it depends entirely on how many people are available for pvp), then kill them. ~~To be honest, I'm not sure if you *have* to kill them, or just die yourself.~~ Nope: you have to kill them.

## Tier 2/4

Investigate the Soulmate. More often than not what will happen is you'll trigger the Soulmate and queue for another pvp match. Why does this need to be so hard? In one go 'round, I spent 15 minutes trying to find the right pixel that would let me continue the mission. This should have been moved off into a separate item, or had the front trigger the queue and the back trigger the quest progression. Or *something*.

There are seven types of "flames" in the text message:

  - Purple flames on oil slicks at sea.
  - Flames lapping up the tower with 8 heads.
  - Flames fueled by the corpses of the fanatical clean dressed.
  - Flames deep underground, fueled by oily black tar.
  - The red flames.
  - The blue flames.
  - The green flames.
  
Go to the Septimus Room in the Tabula Rasa. Obviously.

I'm kidding, of course. This was quite inscrutable. At first I thought "flames" meant the number of lights on the building in the Rosenbrawl dimension. There are eight. Of course I didn't know what to do after that. So I cheated and looked up a hint on reddit. I think the hints were worse than the puzzle itself. The first one had me counting the number if instances of the word "flames" in the text message (13, or 14 if you also count a single "flame".) Then the next hint said "there are only a few places where numbers matter in the game." To be honest, it had been a while since I last played, and while I enjoy the game, I don't commit all places and things to memory. So this didn't help. In the end, I cheated more. Which was fine, because the next tier was worse, especially with the "don't get hit" achievement.

## Tier 3/4

Outside the Tabula Rasa there is an npc with purple hair wearing a bee mask and black and gold gaia armor (across the street from Rosenbaum, to the left by the fence.) Walk up to her and she runs away.

And then don't get hit.

Most of the obstacles are simple enough, although I was somewhat insulted by the "you're getting too far away, the mission will fail" message as you turn the first corner. You can't go any faster; it just seems like the quest designer was twisting the knife.

Follow the girl with the abhorent texts. When she runs into an alley and drops giant red circles of doom, just keep in mind that you'll need to go *up* after them. I think that's what the green circle on the landing is supposed to indicate, but it's very easy to miss; I ran right past it. It's not as though there's suddenly a lack of traps, you run straight into three twisters. But after getting past those and not seeing the girl, then making it all the way past the giant circle in front of the Crusades and suddenly failing the mission (three times), on a lark I went up. I wasn't pleased with myself.

It looks like you can't get past the last twitster on the catwalk. Just time the dodge right. No damage. Sometimes. Might be better to try your luck by jumping down and running through the big twisters.

Once past all the other hinderances you end up in the Haitian Market heading toward the Haitian restaurant. At this point, the girl deserves death.

## Tier 4/4

So give her death. Just remember: standing in her flame attacks will cancel out the debuff from her ice attacks. Don't let the ice stack reach 10 or you'll die.
